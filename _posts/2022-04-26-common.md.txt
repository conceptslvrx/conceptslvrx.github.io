Able to do multiple things that would speed up and alter the workflow of image analysis - in a positive way, sync between two different clients, face detection and ability to easily transition into Adobe's other programs like Adobe Photoshop.

Q: Can Face detection be run on one machine and then sync results to other Lightrooms?
A: _PRO:_ Syncing between different Lightroom users is a feature.

|  Pros  |   Cons  |
|---------  |---------  |
| Face detection  | Face Detection could make more work; unfamiliar to artists  |
| Sync files between clients  | Another thing to download.  |
| Flag frames, with flagged/rejected flags  |        |
| Faster workflow for deleting flagged images.  |        |

_The real questions to ask is if this is right for what you're looking to do. For me when I needed it to sort frames for videos, I felt it was sufficient for multiple editors, the ease of learning the program, and workflow speed increases, and for the reasons listed above._
